# Service Agreement

This is a legal agreement I had drafted a long time ago by a former director of legal at a creative agency, for my design contracts. Over the years I've rewritten parts of it myself and had another lawyer review it for different clients, etc. 

I got tired of editing a Microsoft word document, so I reformatted everything in markdown to work with iA writer's variable.

## How to use it
1. Use [iA writer](https://iawriter.com) to edit `service-agreement.md`
2. Edit the variables at the top of the document to update the agreement details.
3. Update the Exhibit A and B sections, which include the statement of work, payment schedule, list of deliverables, etc.
4. Export as a PDF from iA writer. See `service-agreement-example.pdf` for a demo.
